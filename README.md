## BackpackerProject

This project was done as my college mini project, which is a web application built with python django framework where users can filter/search travel packages by various parameters.
It will filter down the packages according to the parameters after choosing the best package user can book slots in the package.

To run the project 
clone the project then run the following command
```
pip install requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver
```
After that the app can be opened in localhost port number 8000 http://127.0.0.1:8000/
